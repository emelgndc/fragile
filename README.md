Year 13 Digital Technology Science project

This is a project I worked on in my last year at high school. This was mainly a coding project that I undertook for Digital Tech, but I also used this game as the context for my Design portfolio as well. There's still a lot of bugs which you might notice - this was my first time working with Unity as well as C#, so my code is probably extremely suboptimal.

Controls:
Arrow keys to move
C to jump
X to dash
Z to wallclimb
V to submit/press menu buttons
Esc to pause

Note: Sometimes pressing V on 'New Game' won't seem to do anything - just press it again and it should work.
